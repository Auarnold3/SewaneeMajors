<b>Major Description:</b><br>
      American Studies is an interdisciplinary major that fosters an understanding of past and contemporary American culture. While requiring a substantial foundation in American literature and history, the program also encourages students to explore nontraditional methods and subjects. The major is assembled usually from the fields of history, literature, anthropology, politics, religion, and art history. The junior seminar for majors introduces students to important methodological and theoretical problems in the study of American culture. During the first semester of the senior year, students undertake an independent and interdisciplinary research project. The comprehensive examination in the second semester of the senior year covers the particular program of required classes and electives the student has chosen.<br>
