<b>Major Description:</b><br>
A student major is required to take Anthropology 104; either 106, 107, or 109; and 391, 401, and 403. Majors must additionally take five electives for a minimum of ten courses in anthropology. EnSt 332 may be used as one of these electives. No more than one 444 may count towards the five required electives. A major must also designate a department-approved area or a topical specialty by either:  l) spending a semester abroad to acquire experience in another culture, or 2) taking two upper-level courses outside of anthropology either a) in a single discipline (e.g. history, religion, economics, political science, art, theatre, music, psychology) or b) related to a single area of the world (Asia, Oceania, Africa, Europe, or Latin America). Junior Tutorial 391 is taken in the second semester of the junior year and majors are encouraged to study abroad in the first semester of the junior year. Students satisfy a requirement in methods by taking 401, but may also take another pre-approved course or a pre-approved ethnographic or archaeological field school for methods credit. Students complete a paper or report on their methods field work (cultural or archaeological). Majors are strongly urged to take a course in statistics.
<br><br>
Comprehensives are given in two parts during the studentâ€™s last semester: a written exam and an oral defense of both their written answers and their field methods reports. In October of the senior year, students may apply for honors if they have a "B+" or higher grade point average in the major. To apply, students submit a project proposal to the department chair for a 40-page paper on their area of specialty. The project is to be researched and written in the second semester of the senior year. Those applicants invited to complete an honors project register for a full course (Anthro 405: Honors Thesis) and work with a departmental faculty member to submit the project in mid-April.<br>
