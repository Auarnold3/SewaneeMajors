<b>Art Major Description:</b><br>
      The Studio Art program offers classes in six disciplines: Digital Arts, Drawing, Painting, Photography, Sculpture, and Video.
<br><br>
Majors are required to take both of the core courses (Art 101 and 102), two 300-level courses, the two capstone senior seminars (Art 420 and 430), one course in Art History, and Art electives for a total of ten courses.
<br><br>
The comprehensive examination for studio art majors includes the following: preparation and presentation of a portfolio produced over the course of at least one year, participation in a senior exhibition along with the submission of an artist’s statement, writing a thesis paper, undergoing a private defense of the portfolio and thesis, and giving a public presentation with response to questions from the audience. The comprehensive exam result is based on passing all of these components.
<br><br>
Students with a department GPA of at least 3.2 by the end of their junior year are eligible to apply for department honors. To apply for honors, a student must submit a proposal for a thesis project by the designated date during the first semester of his or her senior year. Those students whose proposals have been approved will, in addition to fulfilling the comprehensive exam requirements, assemble a solo exhibition along with the submission of an artist’s statement, write an extended thesis paper, undergo a private defense of the exhibition and thesis, and give a public presentation with response to questions from the audience. Final determination of honors is based on the quality of all of these components.

      <b>Art History Major Description:</b><br>
The degree requirements for students majoring in art history consist of ten full courses (forty semester hours) and a comprehensive examination. Students planning to major in art history are strongly encouraged to complete a range of courses in complementary disciplines, including studio art, literature, history, philosophy, and religion. Majors are also advised to study abroad.

The required ten courses must include the two Western art surveys (ArtH 103 and ArtH 104) and Approaches to Art History (ArtH 317), as well as seven additional art-history courses chosen by the student. At least three of the seven must be selected from each of three chronological areas:
      <br><br>
      <b>Area 1</b>
      <ul>
      <li>ArtH 312: Greek and Roman Art and Architecture</li>
      <li>ArtH 320: Medieval Art and Architecture</li>
      <li>ArtH 322: Art and Devotion in Late Medieval and Early Modern Northern Europe</li>
          <li>ArtH 325: Italian Renaissance Art and Architecture</li>
          <li>ArtH 326: Northern Renaissance Art</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Area 2</b>
      <ul>
      <li>ArtH 202: History of Photography</li>
          <li>ArtH 332: Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Art</li>
          <li>ArtH 333: French Art</li>
          <li>ArtH 335: Nineteenth-Century Art</li>
          <li>ArtH 338: British Art</li>
          <li>ArtH 340: American Art</li>
          <li>ArtH 350: Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Area 3</b>
      <ul>
      <li>ArtH 108: History of Film: Invention to Mid-Century</li>
          <li>ArtH 212: American Animation, 1910-1960</li>
          <li>ArtH 317: Approaches to Art History</li>
          <li>ArtH 345: Modern Art</li>
          <li>ArtH 346: Contemporary Art</li>
          <li>ArtH 351: Conceptual Art</li>
          <li>ArtH 360: Pop Art</li>
          <li>ArtH 370: Art in Germany: 1919-1933</li>
      </ul>
      
      Students will also choose one of the three chronological areas as their area of special interest and take at least one additional art-history course in that area. Majors should complete the two art-history surveys by the conclusion of the first semester of the junior year; the three chronological-area courses must be completed at Sewanee.
<br><br>
Subject to approval by the art history faculty, the department may accept up to two courses (eight hours) in art history from other institutions. Exceptions to this limit are decided by the chair.
<br><br>
To receive departmental honors, a student must have a departmental GPA of 3.5 at the end of the final semester, pass the comprehensive examination with distinction, that is, with an overall score of 88, and earn a grade of B+ or higher on an honors research paper. Eligibility for departmental honors depends on completion of Approaches to Art History (ArtH 317) with a grade of B+ or higher and a departmental GPA of 3.5 at the end of the first semester of the senior year. Eligible majors may then, at the discretion of the chair, elect a course of independent study (ArtH 444) and write an honors research paper under the direction of a member of the art history faculty.
<br><br>
Students interested in advanced placement into upper-division art history courses should consult the department.
