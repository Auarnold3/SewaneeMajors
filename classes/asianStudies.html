Home to well over half the world's population, Asia's rich and varied traditions invite study as well as reflection. The Asian Studies Program introduces students to Asia as a culturally-rooted but dynamic region. Our courses present the building blocks of these civilizations: Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, family structure, symbolism, language, and ethics, as well as the forces of modernization and economic development.

      <b>Major in Asian Studies:</b> Asian Studies is an interdisciplinary major that brings together courses about Asia from a variety of departments and disciplines.

The requirements of the program are described below (see A-G):
<br><br>
A. Completion of ten or more courses in Asian Studies from the lists below or from a study-abroad program (with the approval of the Asian Studies Program Chair).
<br><br>
B. Study abroad for a summer or semester in an Asian country (travel programs do not fulfill this requirement).
<br><br>
C. Completion of one or more courses in an Asian language at or above the 300-level or completion of an intensive language program abroad approved by the Asian Studies Program Chair. Meeting the college language requirement does not meet the Asian Studies requirementâ€”courses only at or above the 300-level count toward the Asian Studies major.
