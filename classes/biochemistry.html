<b>Biochemistry Major Description:</b><br>
The biochemistry major is an interdisciplinary major administered by the departments of Biology and Chemistry. The field of biochemistry comprises the following courses:
      <br><br>
      <b>Group A</b>
      <ul>
      <li>BIOL 233: Intermediate Cell and Molecular Biology</li>
      <li>BIOL 316 (also CHEM 316): Biochemistry of Metabolism and Molecular Biology</li>
      <li>CHEM 201: Organic Chemistry I</li>
          <li>CHEM 202: Organic Chemistry II</li>
          <li>CHEM 307 (also BIOL 307): Mechanistic Biochemistry</li>
          <li>CHEM 352: Thermodynamics and Kinetics</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Group B</b>
      <ul>
      <li>BIOL 280: Molecular Genetics</li>
          <li>BIOL 301: Genetics</li>
          <li>BIOL 318 or 328: Molecular Revolutions in Medicine</li>
          <li>BIOL 319 or 320: Cancer Cell Biology</li>
          <li>BIOL 321: Cell Biology</li>
          <li>BIOL 330 or 331: Immunology</li>
          <li>BIOL 340: Microbiology</li>
          <li>BIOL 350 or 351: Environmental Physiology and Biochemistry of Animals</li>
          <li>BIOL 380 or 381: Genomics</li>
          <li>BIOL 388 or 389: Epigenetics</li>
          <li>CHEM 308: Inorganic Chemistry</li>
          <li>CHEM 311: Chemical Analysis</li>
          <li>CHEM 415: Mechanistic Enzymology</li>
          <li>CHEM 417: Advanced Biochemistry</li>
          <li>CHEM 418: Structural Methods</li>
          <li>CHEM 425: Drug Design and Development</li>
      </ul><br>
      
To major in biochemistry a student must successfully complete all of the courses listed in Group A and at least two of the courses listed in Group B.
<br><br>
Additional requirements are BIOL 132 or BIOL 133, CHEM 102, MATH 102, and PHYS 101.
<br><br>
In order to receive honors in biochemistry, a student must have a 3.20 or higher GPA in the major courses and must complete a research project that the biochemistry committee considers worthy of honors. The research project may be done as part of a course (usually BIOL 444 or CHEM 494), or it may be done in the context of a summer research program at this University or at another institution. The honors project must involve some original work. A formal written report and seminar presentation on the research are required. Students must inform the biochemistry committee of their intention to seek honors no later than October 1 of their senior year.
