A student accepted to any of these majors in the classics department is assigned a reading list of ancient authors and modern works bearing on the languages, literatures, and civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome. Part of the comprehensive examination is based on these readings. To be eligible for departmental honors, a student majoring in classical languages, Greek, or Latin is required to pass all courses in the major with an average of B, to pass the comprehensive examination with a grade of A or B, and to complete an acceptable honors paper.

Departmental Programs and Opportunities: The University is a member of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, and majors are encouraged to study there for one semester. The James M. Fourmy Jr. Scholarship is awarded annually to a deserving and qualified graduate of this University for graduate study in classical languages. The Charles M. Binnicker Endowment Fund for foreign study of classical languages provides aid to our students who wish to study abroad.

Core Requirement (applies only to the Class of 2016 and earlier): The foreign language requirement can be satisfied by any Latin course numbered 300–305.
