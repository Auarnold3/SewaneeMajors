Major in computer science: A major in computer science must take the introductory courses — Computer Science 157, 257, 270; advanced courses — Computer Science 320, 284, 428; and three elective courses chosen from among the computer science courses numbered above 270 to be selected in consultation with the departmental advisor. Mathematics 301, which emphasizes both numerical and symbolic computing, may serve as one of the required computer science elective courses. In addition, computer science majors must take Mathematics 101, 215, and one additional mathematics or statistics course numbered 102 or higher. With the permission of the department, students who are well prepared may begin their computer science sequence with Computer Science 257.
<br><br>
Departmental honors may be conferred on students considered worthy of distinction. Most of the following accomplishments are generally expected:
<br><br>
1) an average of at least 3.5 in computer science courses numbered 300 and higher;
<br>
2) a superior performance on both the written and oral comprehensive examination;
<br>
3) an original project, usually as part of a 444 computer science elective course, and oral defense or presentation of the work;
<br>
4) additional course work in computer science beyond the minimum requirement.
