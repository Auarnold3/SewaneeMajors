Study abroad is recommended from programs such as:
<br><br>
    Organization for Tropical Studies (Costa Rica or South Africa)
    School for International Training (from a variety of countries)
    Sea Semester
<br><br>
Note that many graduate programs in ecology and biodiversity require one or more semesters of physical science (chemistry, geology, and/or physics)
Required for a B.S. (but not for a B.A.) in Ecology and Biodiversity:
<br><br>
Statistics, and three additional Math/Stat/science classes outside Biology, including at least two lab science classes.
<br>
Note: The major field is defined as all Biology classes listed above, Biol 130, EnSt 140, EnSt 200, EnSt 217, EnSt 240, EnSt 317, and EnSt 400. Study abroad courses count inside the major field if the majority of the work in the course concerns the scientific study of ecology and biodiversity; study abroad courses will count outside the major field if the majority of the work for the course concerns social science, humanities or other work outside the natural sciences.
