Program Mission
<br><br>
The Environmental Studies Program at Sewanee offers students an unusually rich array of curricular options including four majors, one minor, and a certificate. This expansive curriculum — including natural and social sciences as well as the humanities and fine arts — offers students multiple pathways to appreciating the ecological complexity and wonder of the earth we inhabit. The Program’s spread of curricular options across four diverse majors enables majors to develop not only depth of exposure to certain fields and methodologies of study, but also cross-disciplinary breadth of understanding. This broad-gauged outlook is crucial for graduates looking to address the inherently interdisciplinary challenges of environmental study in today’s world. So while each of the four majors has its own, largely autonomous pattern of faculty-administrative oversight, an overarching belief in the value and need for interdisciplinary inquiry suffuses the entire program. Students enrolled in all four majors also share common exposure to the Program’s team-taught offering, “Introduction to Environmental Studies” (EnSt 101), as well as involvement in various other collaborative opportunities and occasions for interaction across academic disciplines.
 <br><br>
A major asset of the Environmental Studies Program at Sewanee is the unparalleled opportunity for field study available throughout the University’s 13,000-acre land-base, commonly known as “the Domain.” This extensive tract includes extensive woodlands, lakes, trails, caves, and bluffs that surround the central campus and encompass the residential village of Sewanee. The Domain’s amalgamation of wildlife preserve, working forest, farmland, and settlements thus offers students and faculty members rare benefit as a “living laboratory” for inquiry.
<br><br>

The four majors available are those in Ecology and Biodiversity, Environmental Arts and Humanities, Environment and Sustainability, and Natural Resources and the Environment. Each major requires eleven courses, including EnSt 101 and a senior capstone course.

This focus must contain three courses from a minimum of two departments (preferably three) that have a central theme related to the student’s senior capstone project. Courses listed above under Environmental Economics and Policy but not selected to fulfill the requirement, may be applied toward a focus. An appropriate special topics course or independent study (ENSC 444) may also be used to satisfy one of the foci requirements. The Environment and Sustainability steering committee must approve each self-designed focus prior to the end of the first semester of the junior year. The ultimate goal of the foci is to provide students with a cohesive interdisciplinary experience while preparing them to complete capstone projects, in collaboration with faculty mentors, that offer substantial research potential.

Watershed Science Certificate:
The Watershed Science Certificate is designed for students interested in gaining a better understanding of the interactions among the physical, chemical, and biological factors that affect our watersheds and wetlands. Students pursuing the certificate take a range of courses that focus on water resources and watershed science. In addition to hydrology, students take at least one half-course in applied watershed science, and choose additional watershed science courses from a list that contains offerings in a variety of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, forestry, geology, and environmental studies. Each student completes the Certificate with the Watershed Science Capstone course, a multidisciplinary, project oriented course in which students address issues related to two or more of the following topic areas: the interaction of biological processes and watershed function, chemical processes in streams and watersheds, the relationship between forested landscapes and hydrologic systems, or geological processes in terrestrial aquatic systems. The capstone project may be a semester project created solely for the capstone, or may begin as a watershed-related summer internship project that is further developed by the student during an academic semester.
<br><br>
Students who obtain the Certificate will be better prepared to pursue graduate training in watershed science and other hydrologic disciplines, or to begin careers associated with watershed science and management.
<br><br>
Students deciding to pursue the certificate should contact one of the faculty members of the Watershed Certificate Organizing Committee to develop his or her study plan. The Organizing Committee is also available to help a student identify his or her area of emphasis and primary faculty supervisor for the ESci 430 Watershed Science Capstone; together the student and primary supervisor identify the second discipline and arrange to work with a faculty member in that area.

Religion and Environment Minor:
<br><br>
    Emeritus Professor Robin Gottfried, Director
    Offered by interdisciplinary faculty, in conjunction with the Environmental Studies Program and the Center for Religion and Environment
<br><br>
The ways we interact with the natural world reflect the deep-seated values of the society to which we belong and the experiences of nature we have as individuals. Religion, and the spiritual experiences of individuals that inform religious thought, provide profound insights into how we perceive the world around us and guidance as to how to interact with it. The minor in religion and environment encourages students to integrate religious insights and spiritual experience with the natural and social sciences to better understand how religion and the natural world affect one another. Accordingly, the minor includes coursework in natural and social environmental science along with coursework in religion. Because the minor encourages students to reflect on their own spiritual experience and beliefs as they relate to the environment, it culminates in a capstone experiential course involving environmentally related service or action along with reflection on the meaning of that engagement.
