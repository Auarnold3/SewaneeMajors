DEPARTMENT MISSION
<br><br>
Forestry, geology, watershed analysis, and environmental study are the emphases of the Department of Forestry and Geology. Students analyze the physical, biological, hydrological, and chemical components of natural landscapes, and also address the economic, social, and political aspects of environmental issues as part of their study. The department stresses work both within and outside the classroom, and trains students to integrate their field observations with theoretical concepts and analytical data.
<br><br>
The department offers three majors, a certificate, and two minors.
<br><br>
The three majors:
<br><br>
Forestry: A study of forest ecosystems and the environmental components and processes (biological, physical, and chemical) that affect them.
<br><br>
Geology: A study of processes affecting the earth — geological, hydrological, and chemical.
<br><br>
Natural Resources and the Environment: An interdisciplinary environmental major that integrates coursework in forest ecosystems and geology with other environmental coursework. (This major is offered in collaboration with the Environmental Studies Program.)
<br><br>
Watershed Science Certificate: A component of the Environmental Studies Program and more fully described under that heading, the Certificate is designed for students interested in gaining a better understanding of the interactions among physical, chemical, and biological factors that affect our watersheds and wetlands. Students pursuing the Certificate take a range of courses focusing on water resources and watershed science.
<br><br>
Forestry Minor: A student may minor in forestry by completing four of the following courses:
<br>
<br>Fors 211: Dendrology
<br>Fors 262: Forest and Watershed Restoration
<br>Fors 303: Soils
<br>Fors 305: Forest Ecology
<br>Fors 312: Silviculture
<br>Fors 319: Natural Resource Management Decisions
<br>
Students must have an average grade of C or higher in these four courses. No comprehensive examination is required for a minor in forestry. Forestry minors who propose taking any of the required courses outside of Sewanee must seek prior approval before taking such a course.
<br><br>
Geology Minor: A student may minor in geology by completing the following courses:
<br><br>
1. Geol 314: Hydrology
<br><br>
2. One of the following:
<br><br>
Geol 215: Economic Geological Resources
<br>Geol 221: Mineralogy
<br>
3. One of the following:
<br><br>
<br>Geol 222: Historical Geology
<br>Geol 225: Sedimentology
<br>Geol 325: Field and Structural Geology
<br>
4. One additional four-credit laboratory course in geology at the 200- or 300-level
<br><br>
Students must achieve an average grade of C (2.00) or higher in the four required courses. No comprehensive examination is required. Geology minors who propose taking any of the required courses elsewhere than Sewanee must seek prior approval before taking such a course.
<br><br>
All three majors in the Department of Forestry and Geology emphasize an interdisciplinary study of the natural world and the interrelationships between geological, hydrological, and forest ecological processes. Excellent forest and geological exposures on the University Domain and its environs, along with the stream drainages that comprise local watersheds, are the focus of both lab and field study. Other sites in the Appalachians, Rocky Mountains, Colorado Plateau region, Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, and St. Catherine's barrier island environment are also studied in specific courses. Students in all majors develop skills appropriate to the study of forested and geologic systems. These include skills in computer use/analysis (database, word processing, and/or GIS software), field identifications, laboratory analysis, and mapping and spatial analysis of variables in the field. Graduating seniors must demonstrate a broad knowledge of environmental issues (local, regional, and global) and must be competent in both oral and written communication skills. As part of this goal, all juniors in the department complete an oral presentations course, and all seniors complete a collaborative and interdisciplinary senior field research project.
<br><br>
Students interested in majoring in forestry, geology, or natural resources and the environment have choices in required coursework, and they are advised to consult with a member of the department early in their college career to plan a sequence of courses appropriate to their interests and objectives. Students interested in careers in forestry or environmental study may choose to participate in a 3-2 Cooperative College program with Duke University, with three years of work at Sewanee and two years at Duke, to obtain both a Sewanee bachelor's degree and one of two master's degrees at Duke: Master of Environmental Management (MEM) or Master of Forestry (MF).
Natural Resources and the Environment Major: An interdisciplinary environmental major that integrates coursework in forest ecosystems and geology with the broad range of potential environmental coursework offered at Sewanee.
<br><br>
All Natural Resources and the Environment majors take the introductory forestry and geology courses (Fors 121 and Geol 121); a complementary science course in biology, chemistry, or physics; the department’s oral presentations seminar; and the department’s interdisciplinary senior field project course. The remaining 4 required core and 3 elective courses are chosen by the student, in consultation with his/her faculty advisor, to match the student’s specific interests.

Forestry Major: A study of forest ecosystems and the environmental components and processes (biological, physical, and chemical) that affect them.
<br><br>
Forestry majors at Sewanee are broadly trained to integrate traditional forestry coursework (dendrology, silviculture, forest ecology, and natural resource management) with courses outside the department in biology, chemistry, economics, and mathematics. Courses in soils, hydrology, natural resource policy, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), wildlife management, urban forest management, and tropical and boreal forestry are also either encouraged or required. Forestry majors participate in the department’s junior presentations seminar and senior capstone interdisciplinary field course along with all students majoring in Geology or Natural Resources and the Environment.

Required coursework in geology is integrated with required or recommended coursework in forestry, soils, hydrology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. (A summer geology field camp taken at another institution is strongly recommended as it is required for admission to many graduate schools.)

<br><br>
Natural Science Core Requirement (applies only to the Class of 2016 and earlier): In geology, all courses may be counted toward the 2.b. natural science core distribution requirement. In forestry, all courses except forestry 201, 260, and 319 may be counted toward this requirement.
<br><br>
Writing-Intensive Course in the Major Requirement
Students majoring in Forestry, Geology, or Natural Resources and the Environment can satisfy their Writing-in-the-Major requirement by
<br>(1) successfully completing Geology 320, or other designated Writing-Intensive course in the department, or
<br>(2) by successfully completing four Forestry and/or Geology designated “Writing Portfolio” courses. Written and edited scientific papers from each Writing Portfolio course are to be compiled into a Scientific Writing Portfolio by each student, and maintained by his/her advisor.
<br><br>
The following courses are designated as Writing Portfolio or Writing-Intensive courses in the Department of Forestry and Geology. Other courses may be approved as such during some years. In exceptional cases and by faculty permission, one of the four Writing Portfolio courses might be fulfilled by a Fors 444 or Geol 444 Independent Study course.
