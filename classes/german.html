Only German language, literature and culture courses taken at the University of the South may be used to complete the college language requirement for graduation.
<br><br>
Students who have completed two or more years of German in secondary school must take the departmental placement examination. Students who elect to enroll at a course beneath that indicated by the placement examination receive credit only if departmental permission is obtained prior to registration in the course.
<br><br>
Major in German: The requirement for majors in German is eight full courses at the 300 level and above. At least three of these courses must be at the 400 level. Also required is a period of study in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland. Those planning to continue the German major in graduate school may wish to take more credit hours in the department. Both language and cultural proficiency are emphasized, along with reading and discussing literary texts.
<br><br>
Minor in German: A student wishing to increase proficiency in German and complement another field of study, such as economics, English, geology/forestry, history, political science, religion or the sciences, may minor in German by taking at least five courses in German language, literature and culture at the 300 level and above. A period of study/work abroad is desirable. No comprehensive exam is required.
<br><br>
As an alternative to dormitory living, the department also maintains a German House, which comfortably accommodates seven students wanting to improve their conversational German on a daily basis. A German exchange student also resides in the house and helps students with their language learning. Occasional cultural events are also held there.
<br><br>
Students who have performed with distinction may apply in their penultimate semester for departmental honors. If approved, they are requested to write a research paper in connection with a German 444 course (one to four credits). Students demonstrating excellence in both this paper and their written comprehensives are awarded departmental honors.
