The major in International and Global Studies examines the economic, political and socio-cultural processes that in both the past and present have contributed to the creation of our globalized world. The cross-border flows we see today of people, media, technology, politics and finance are not new, but they operate on a new level of complexity and speed such that our world is now inextricably interconnected and interdependent at the most fundamental levels of human organization and practice. Global citizenship today requires understanding that contemporary cultural, political and economic phenomena are transnational in nature, crossing borders and boundaries in both creative and destructive ways. However, it also requires knowledge that global processes are not abstract and disembodied forces, but rather are processes that humans create and maintain. As such, they are shaped by the specific cultural and historic structures that inform human interactions in particular places. Thus, the major in International and Global Studies allows students to combine study of global forces with both analysis and real-world experience of how these global forces shape and re-shape the lives of human beings living in specific cultural contexts.

The skills students learn from the combination of course work, abroad experience, and language learning foster their successful navigation of this complex global world. The interdisciplinary approach to the topic of globalization and its localization in distinct world regions allows students to perceive the value of distinct perspectives. In the senior seminar and comprehensive exams, they learn to integrate and synthesize those perspectives across disciplinary and thematic boundaries in the creation of a more holistic view of the topic or problem they seek to address. Through abroad experiences students apply knowledge learned in the class room to real-world settings, and in the process develop language-learning skills, and learn to interact constructively across cultural, economic, and political boundaries.

Core Requirements
The minimal degree requirements for students majoring in IGS consist of 10 full courses and a comprehensive examination to be taken in the senior year. Of the 10 courses taken for the major, two courses are required: an introductory course (InGS 200) to be taken in the sophomore year, and a senior capstone seminar (InGS 400) to be taken in the fall of the senior year. The remaining courses are eight distributed electives, one of which will likely be taken in a foreign language. If one of the eight distributed electives is not taken in a foreign language, then one additional language course (for a total of 11 courses) must be taken to complete the major (see below for more on the language requirement). Lastly, no more than four of the eight elective courses may be taken from any one department.

The major course of study is divided into two broad categories: “thematic” which investigates global processes of various types, and “geographic” which explores how global forces are materialized differently in different contexts. The “thematic” and “geographic” categories are further sub-divided into sub-categories of courses upon which students may focus their studies:
Geographic Sub-categories: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean,The Middle East, Russia and Eurasia;  and
Thematic Sub-categories: Global Capitalism, Global Culture and Society, and Global Politics
Students take eight elective courses, four of which must be thematic, and four of which must be geographic. Four courses must be in a single sub-category, and the remaining four can be taken in a single sub-category, or split evenly (2/2) between two other sub-categories. Students may not take fewer than two courses in any sub-category, and may not take more than four courses in any sub-category.
<br><br>
Many of the courses offered in the IGS catalogue require introductory level prerequisites. We encourage students who are considering the IGS major to review the courses they are especially interested in taking, and make sure they have taken the required introductory-level courses in their respective departments. These may count toward the General Distribution Requirements and/or a minor field of study. We strongly urge students to consider the relevance of a minor field of study to their overall educational and career goals, and to use a minor to complement and strengthen their IGS major.

Shortly after signing up for the IGS major, students determine in consultation with their advisor and the chair their planned course of study in the major. This should include discussion not only of planned areas of focus, but also the abroad experiences, language training, and possible minor course of study that make the most sense for that student. Keeping the coherence of the educational experience in mind is especially important in IGS as the senior thesis (written in InGS 400) depends upon it. Nonetheless, the planned program of study may be subject to change as the student progresses through the major, and should be reviewed with the advisor and chair should this occur.

Comprehensive Examination
Each student completes a comprehensive examination in the first semester of their senior year. The comprehensive is broadly integrative, consisting of two parts. The first part is a seminar paper written in InGS 400 that integrates materials from the eight elective courses taken in the student’s chosen thematic and geographic sub-categories of focus. The second part is an essay answering a question about themes and concepts in globalization learned in InGS 200 and 400.
