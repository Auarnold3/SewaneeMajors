Medieval Colloquium: The Sewanee Medieval Colloquium is an annual, interdisciplinary conference attended by medievalists from throughout the United States.
<br><br>
Major in medieval studies: The Medieval Studies Program provides the structure within departmental course offerings for a comprehensive major in a particular area of concentration in the medieval period — such as literature, history, or philosophy — chosen by the student and approved by the committee at the time the major is declared. The program consists of three parts:
<br><br>
I. Required Courses (eight full courses total)
<br>Art (one full course)
<br>ArtH 320: Medieval Art and Architecture
<br><br>
Classics (one full course from the following)
<br>Latn 405: Medieval Latin
<br>another medieval language class in addition to completion of Latn 104: Beginning Latin
<br>Engl 301: Anglo-Saxon Language and Literature
<br>Fren 401: Early French Literature
<br>an independent study in another medieval language (with permission from the Chair of Medieval Studies)
<br><br>
English (two full courses from the following)
<br>Engl 350: Medieval Drama and its Legacy
<br>Engl 351: Medieval English Literature
<br>Engl 352: Chaucer
<br><br>
History (two full courses from the following)
<br>Hist 303: Constructing Christendom: the West from Constantine to the First Crusade
<br>Hist 304: Medieval Europe
<br>Hist 305: Medieval Women — In Their Own Words
<br>Hist 365: Medieval England I
<br>Hist 366: Medieval England II
<br>Hist 368: Saints and Society in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages
<br><br>
Philosophy (both of the following full courses)
<br>Phil 203: Ancient Philosophy from Homer to Augustine
<br>Phil 302: Medieval Philosophy
<br><br>
II. Research Project and Paper — Majors are required to carry through a research project culminating in a paper of interdisciplinary character in the chosen area of concentration, whose subject is approved by the committee at the beginning of the senior year. The project is directed by a member of the committee but evaluated by an interdisciplinary panel.
<br><br>
III. Electives — Elective courses are recommended by the committee in accordance with the student's approved area of concentration from among upper-level course offerings in various disciplines.
<br><br>
Majors must pass a written comprehensive examination of interdisciplinary character devised and judged by an interdisciplinary panel. A citation of honors on the research paper and on the written comprehensive examination by a majority of the members of the examining panel qualify the major for honors.
<br><br>
Majors are encouraged to satisfy the college language requirement with Latin as early as possible and to complete the program requirement in Latin at their first opportunity. Familiarity with a vernacular language other than English is desirable.
<br><br>
Travel and study abroad are highly desirable for students electing this major. They are encouraged to participate in British Studies at Oxford, European Studies, the semester at the Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies at Oxford, or other established programs.
