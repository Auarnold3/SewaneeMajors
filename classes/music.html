The department offers a variety of courses in music history and music theory in addition to performance instruction in selected areas. Courses of study are designed to meet the needs of both l) the student who wants to study music as a discipline of the humanities within the context of a general liberal arts education, and 2) the student who wants to pursue graduate studies in musicology, music theory, church music, or one of the performance areas in which the department offers instruction.
<br><br>
*Prospective majors should consult with the department as early as possible in their undergraduate careers to discuss their goals in music and determine the most profitable course of study.
Major in music: A music major selects one of three tracks â€” performance, theory/composition, or music history & culture. Each track requires the completion of 42 credit hours and includes 101 (or 151), 260 (with the prerequisite of 103 or 104), and 301. All majors must pass a comprehensive examination on the history and theory of music. There are also performance, ensemble, and elective requirements tailored to each track.
<br><br>
The music performance track requires 18 hours of performance, split between 12 hours of applied lessons (including 470, the senior recital) and 6 hours in ensemble and/or chamber music. Besides 301 (mentioned above), another course in music history is also required (212 or 213), along with one elective in either theory/composition or music history and culture.
<br><br>
The theory/composition track requires, beyond 260 (mentioned above), another course in theory (360) plus two electives in theory/composition. This track also requires two courses in music history (212 and 213) and 6 hours of performance, split between 2 hours of applied lessons, and 4 hours in ensemble and/or chamber music.
<br><br>
The music history and culture track requires, beyond 301 (mentioned above), two more courses in music history (212 and 213), along with two electives in music history and culture. This track also requires another course in theory (360) beyond 260 (mentioned above), and six hours of performance, split between two hours of applied lessons, and 4 hours in ensemble and/or chamber music.
<br><br>
Music majors demonstrate proficiency at the keyboard with satisfactory completion of 104, 271, 273, 371, or 373.
<br><br>
Students seeking departmental honors must achieve at least a 3.25 average in music courses, contribute to the musical life of Sewanee, and complete a project or thesis deemed worthy of honors by the music faculty.
<br><br>
Minor in music: Music minors must have earned the equivalent of six course credits in music, including: 1) Music 101 or 151; 2) Music 260; and 3) the equivalent of one course in ensemble participation and/or applied study of an instrument or voice.
<br><br>
Membership in the University's choir, orchestra, and other performance ensembles is open to all qualified students. Ensemble participation earns one half-course credit for two consecutive semesters of participation. Credit for ensemble participation is awarded on a pass/fail basis only.
<br><br>
Applied instruction is presently offered in piano, organ, voice, violin, viola, cello, guitar, and the orchestral woodwinds.
