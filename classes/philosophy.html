Core Requirement (applies only to the Class of 2016 and earlier): Philosophy 101, and all 200-level courses, except 201, fulfill the philosophy-religion degree requirement.
<br><br>
Any course not taken to satisfy a degree requirement may be taken on a pass-fail basis. Courses below the 300 level have no prerequisite. Philosophy 101 and other 200-level courses (except Philosophy 201) are offered every semester and are the normal prerequisite for 300- and 400-level courses.
<br><br>
Major in philosophy: A student majoring in philosophy is expected to take a minimum of ten courses in philosophy. Philosophy 101, 203, and 204 are required of majors. Students must also take at least one course in logic, 190 or 312, as well as at least three of the following seminars — 306, 307, 308, and 309 — during their junior and senior years, with any two of these seminars satisfying the writing-intensive requirement in the major. During their senior year, all students must complete and publicly defend an independent research paper. A comprehensive examination with written and oral components is also required of all majors.
<br><br>
The normal minimum requirements for honors in philosophy are: either an A- average in all work in the department or a pass with distinction on the comprehensive examination; an A- on the senior research paper.
