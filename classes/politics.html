(applies only to the Class of 2016 and earlier:) Students fulfilling the social science requirement are advised that any 100-level or 200-level course in this department may be used to fulfill that requirement.
<br><br>
Major in politics: Students critically engage with competing values and interests that guide and orient politics. They analyze concepts, theories, and principles that deal with the nature, purpose, and characteristics of government and political change. The major encompasses the theoretical and empirical study of government institutions, leadership, conflict resolution between and within states, political ideas and ideologies, political culture and discourse, political economy, and the politics of gender, race, and class.
<br><br>
Introductory courses help to ground students in fundamental theories and concepts used in the study of politics. Seminars and many 300-level courses provide students opportunities to develop their research and analytical skills while also introducing students to how to write within the discipline.
<br><br>
Students majoring in politics are required to complete at least eleven courses, including two introductory (100-level) courses; three concentrations (three courses in each chosen concentration); a seminar at the 400-level; and a comprehensive examination.
<br><br>
Students select courses that fall into the following eight concentrations: (1) development/political economy, (2) law and justice, (3) national institutions and policies, (4) global institutions and policies, (5) conflict and peace, (6) identity and diversity, (7) citizenship, and (8) political action. A course may fall into more than one concentration, but students may apply it toward satisfying only one of their chosen concentrations.
<br><br>
For the comprehensive examination, students must respond to one from a panel of questions for each of their three selected concentrations. Independent studies and honors projects will be placed in appropriate categories by the chair of the department. The public affairs internship course (Pols 445) is excluded from coverage on the comprehensive examination and counts as a course outside the major.
<br><br>
Minor in politics: A minor in politics consists of five courses, at least three of which must be above the 100-level. There is no comprehensive examination for the minor.
<br><br>
Honors in politics: Students who have taken a minimum of six politics courses with a departmental grade point average of at least 3.4 may request enrollment in the Honors Tutorial (Pols 450) during the fall of their senior year. As a condition for enrollment, a preliminary research proposal must first be approved by the departmentâ€™s faculty. Departmental honors are awarded to a student who maintains a grade point average of 3.4 or higher in departmental courses, submits an honors paper of at least B+ quality, and receives distinction on the comprehensive exam. Candidates for honors also make an oral presentation of their honors paper to an audience of departmental faculty and students.
<br><br>
Other expectations:
Students contemplating professional careers in international affairs are encouraged to take several upper-level courses in economics (for example, microeconomics, macroeconomics, and international economics).
<br><br>
Students considering graduate work in politics are encouraged to take Pols 407: Political Behavior, several economics courses, statistics, and at least one semester of upper-level coursework in political theory.
<br><br>
Those students interested in prelaw are strongly urged to take courses in Anglo-American history and constitutional development, political theory, economics, and logic. The Law School Admissions Test is required for all schools and should be taken early in the senior year.
