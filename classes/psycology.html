Psychology is a diverse discipline that borders on the biological and social sciences. It is at once a science and a means of promoting human welfare. Reflecting its historical roots in philosophy, physiology, and clinical practice, it embraces a variety of theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and areas of study. The Department of Psychology at Sewanee provides majors and non-majors with the basic principles of psychology within the context of a liberal arts education. Our curriculum emphasizes scientific thinking and equips majors with multiple perspectives and research methods with which to understand behavior and mental processes. Graduates of our program pursue advanced study and careers in a variety of areas, including psychology (e.g., industrial, developmental, clinical, school), other helping professions (e.g., social work, physical therapy), and other fields (e.g., law, medicine, education, business).
<br><br>
The psychology major combines a broad grounding in psychology with opportunities for depth in selected areas. Majors in psychology begin with one introductory course: an introduction to empirical psychology, organized topically. This course has a full laboratory component focused on the process of scientific inquiry, giving students experience with a variety of research approaches and methodological issues. A course in research methodology prepares students to design and carry out research. Students also choose survey, seminar, and upper-level laboratory courses in areas such as abnormal, behavior modification, cognitive, developmental, gender, industrial, personality, physiological, and social psychology. Within the major, students choose upper-level courses according to individual interests.
<br><br>
Advanced students may study independently or conduct research under faculty supervision, work as laboratory assistants, or aid faculty members with research. Students have presented their research at Scientific Sewanee and at professional psychology conferences. Summer internships are available through the Tonya program for those who are interested in gaining experience in business or public service. For those students planning to do graduate work in psychology, Stat 204 is highly recommended.
<br><br>
Natural Science Core Requirement (applies only to the Class of 2016 and earlier): Students fulfilling the natural science core requirement in psychology are advised that 100, 251, 357, 358, and 359 are full laboratory science courses. Psyc 101 and all 200-level courses except 202, 206, 213, 251, and 280 are non-laboratory science courses. No 400-level course may be used to fulfill core requirements.

<br>1. one must be an advanced lab (357, 358, 359) and
<br>2. one must be a seminar (402, 403, 406, 408, 410, 411, 412, 420, 430)
<br>3. effective with the class of 2015: majors who take the minimum 10 Psychology courses may count only one Psyc 444 (4 credit hours) toward their major; Psychology majors who take more than 10 Psychology courses may count two Psyc 444 courses (8 credit hours) toward their major.
<br><br>
A major consists of 10 full courses in psychology at minimum.
<br><br>
The Comprehensive Examination
<br>The comprehensive examination consists of a paper that integrates material from three areas in psychology. Ordinarily several possible questions are distributed in January with a mandatory outline submitted in February. The paper is due during the second comprehensive examination period for Easter semester.
<br><br>
For the B.S., also see the Degree Requirements of the College, Additional Requirements for a Bachelor of Science
<br><br>
Honors
<br>Departmental honors are awarded based on distinguished work in psychology during the undergraduate career. Individuals with a cumulative psychology GPA below 3.6 are considered only under extraordinary circumstances. Unlike the college-wide honors (cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude), the decision involves consideration of other factors besides GPA, particularly the quality of any additional intellectual accomplishments in psychology such as independent research, conference presentations, and internships.
<br><br>
Requirements for a minor in psychology: A minor in psychology requires six courses in the department. A student must take either Psyc 100 or 101. In addition a student must take one course numbered 300 or above. Psyc 444 may count as one of the six courses, but it does not satisfy the requirement of one course numbered 300 or above. All courses for the psychology minor must be taken for grades (not P/F). No comprehensive examination.
