The study of religion is central to a liberal arts education and thus to the mission of the University of the South: to be liberally educated, Sewanee students ought to have a direct, critical encounter with religion and the most basic questions of meaning and purpose that religion addresses. Religion courses are designed to raise and reflect upon the central and abiding questions that challenge us all: What is the nature of religion? How does religion live in so many different and interesting ways in human culture? How do human beings throughout history express their deepest beliefs, concerns and faiths? Where do we find and how do we make sense of the Holy? What are our moral commitments and obligations? As citizens of the new millennium, how then shall we live in light of computers and in the shadow of concentration camps? From antiquity to postmodernity, China to Chattanooga, religion is to be encountered shaping human experience. At Sewanee the religion department, students and faculty together, through formal classes, independent study, and co-curricular activities investigate the role of religion and the many faces it presents.

Religion is not one field of study but many; by nature the study of religion is a multi-disciplinary effort that requires investigation of history, culture, values, sacred texts, theology, and philosophical thought. Such study requires familiarity with methods of historical analysis, literary criticism, phenomenological description, and cross-cultural, comparative study. For this reason the study of religion complements well other majors, the women's and gender studies minor, and curricular interests.

Major in religion: The major in religion is satisfied by the completion of at least 10 religion courses. Required for the major are Relg 301 and a concentration made up of at least three courses in the religion department that are united in theme. Students are required to create a theme in conversation with their advisor. Some examples include religion and social power, religion and the environment, textual study in religion, and philosophical approaches to religion. A course outside the department also recommended for religion majors is History 298 (History of Islam).

Departmental honors may be conferred on students considered worthy of distinction. Most of the following accomplishments are generally expected: 1) an average of at least B+ with no grade below a B- in religion courses; 2) a superior performance on the comprehensive examination; 3) a substantial essay or original project, usually as part of a 444 course, and oral defense or presentation of the work; 4) additional course work in religion beyond the minimum requirement, and carefully chosen elective courses in other fields complementing the studentâ€™s work in religion; 5) ability to use a language other than English in the study of religion.
