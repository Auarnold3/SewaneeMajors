(applies only to the Class of 2016 and earlier:) Only Spanish literature and culture courses taken at the University of the South may be used to complete the college language and literature requirement for graduation. Unless otherwise indicated by the placement exam or approved by the department, Spanish 300 is the designated course to fulfill the requirement.
<br><br>
(applies to all students:) Prerequisite for all 400-level courses is a semester at the 300 level, departmental permission, or placement. Students who have taken a course numbered above Spanish 300 may not take Spanish 300 for credit.
<br><br>
Students wishing to take Spanish to fulfill their foreign language requirement must take the departmental placement examination. Those students who have never taken Spanish should consult with the department chair in order to register for Spanish 103. Students who have taken at least two years of Spanish in high school will be placed no lower than Spanish 113. Students may not enroll at a course level beneath that indicated by the placement examination without written permission of the Spanish department chair.

Major in Spanish: The minimum requirement for a Spanish major is ten full courses above Span 300. As the major requires a mastery of Spanish language, Spanish and Latin American literature, and Spanish and Latin American culture, the student is expected to select courses from all of these areas. At least one of these courses must be at the 400-level, though the department strongly recommends several. Spanish 300 does not form part of the major but serves as the prerequisite for higher-level courses.
<br><br>
The program for majors starts with four foundation courses, two in Spain and two in Latin America:
<br>
<br>    301 Cultural Survey of Spain I
<br>    302 Cultural Survey of Spain II
<br>    303 Cultural Survey of Latin America I
<br>    304 Cultural Survey of Latin America II
<br><br>
A Spanish major is strongly encouraged to complete this sequence before taking more advanced courses. In addition to these four courses, students need to choose five (5) more courses, including one at least at the 400-level, plus the Senior Seminar. The Senior Seminar is required for all Spanish majors.
<br><br>
In all classes, students will hone skills in reading, writing, and speaking Spanish, engage with the culture of the Spanish-speaking world, and practice critical thinking. The written and oral comprehensive examinations in Spanish form part of the Senior Seminar. The oral comprehensive examination consists of the presentation of the senior thesis.
<br><br>
Majors are required to spend one semester or the equivalent studying in a Spanish-speaking country. Justifiable exceptions will be considered by written petition.
<br><br>
All majors are encouraged to take a year or more of another foreign language.
<br><br>
Sewanee Summer in Spain is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of Medieval Spain and the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela. Classes meet in Sewanee, in Madrid, and on the pilgrimage road in northern Spain. The program offers credit for two full courses: Spanish 314 and Art History 214, plus Physical Education 214.
<br><br>
The Sewanee Semester in Spain focuses on contemporary Spain and its relationship to and membership in the European Union. It is interdisciplinary in nature, with each course looking at a variety of issues from multiple perspectives. Classes meet in Madrid with professors and tutors from Madrid's Complutense University. The program consists of four full courses: Spanish 331: Advanced Spanish language, Spanish 323: Contemporary Spain, IGS 306: Spain in the European Union, and (number to be determined) Europe: A Community in the Arts.
