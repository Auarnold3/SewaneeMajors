Major in theatre arts: The major in theatre arts is designed to offer the student a strong foundation in all areas of the theatre: acting, directing, design, history, literature, and theory. The department expects its majors to augment their knowledge and experience in these disciplines by active participation in the full production program of Theatre Sewanee, the University theatre. The department also encourages its majors to supplement their work in theatre arts with courses offered by other departments â€” particularly in language, literature, music, art, and art history.
