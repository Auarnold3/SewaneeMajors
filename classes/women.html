The minor in Women's and Gender Studies invites students to examine contributions and representations of women through an interdisciplinary program that employs gender as a fundamental category of analysis. Students engage the scholarly methods and theories of women's and gender studies in ways that complement traditional disciplinary inquiry. Students are encouraged to investigate the historical and contemporary contributions of women as well as the significance of gender in the social and natural sciences, in the arts and literature, and in religion. The minor further invites students to analyze gender in relation to other categories of difference, such as race, class, and ethnicity. The goal of women's and gender studies is to stimulate critical examination of assumptions about gender in cultures past and present.

Requirements for the minor: The minor in Women's and Gender Studies requires students to complete six courses. Two courses, described below and entitled Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies and Women's and Gender Studies Seminar, are required and must be taken at Sewanee. At least two more courses must be chosen from those formally cross-listed as Women's and Gender Studies courses (see below). The remaining two courses may be chosen from the wide array of courses offered in the college, including those already cross-listed as Women's and Gender Studies courses. For a course not already cross-listed this way to be counted in fulfillment of the minor, the course must be approved in advance (i.e., before the student registers for it) by the Women's and Gender Studies committee. Approval is given after consultation with the instructor and agreement that in the context of the course the student  completes either a major project or major paper on a topic relevant to women's studies. Departmental independent studies may be included.
